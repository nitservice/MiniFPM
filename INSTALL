Installation guide
********************************************************

MiniFPM uses cmake to compile.
1. Create a "bin" directory in the project main directory and change to it
     mkdir dir
     cd dir
2. Call cmake with install directory prefix (in the "bin" directory)
     cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. ..
3. Compile the source and install the binaries
     make
     make install

The static library is installed to "lib", the examples to "examples".



Dependencies:
-------------
To compile the source the following packages (development versions) are needed:
    UMFPACK (or SuiteSparse)
    LAPACK/BLAS
There is also support for ADOL-C provided which can be used if the corresponding
library is installed.
